 * on top of whatever the function already returned. That is how a blanket
 * `cache-control: no-store` on `/api/(.*)` came to sit over the schedule-aware
 * `s-maxage` that app/api/live-status/route.ts computes, cancelling the edge
 * cache the route exists to use. Both API routes set their own cache-control on
 * every path they return, so there is nothing for a platform rule to add.
 *
 * Keeping them in Next also means they apply to `next dev`, so a CSP that breaks
 * the site breaks it locally rather than on the first deploy.

 * `script-src` carries 'unsafe-inline' rather than a nonce, and that is a
 * deliberate trade rather than an oversight. A nonce has to be minted per
 * request, which means middleware on every route, which makes every page
 * dynamic — and this site is static plus hourly ISR. Paying for that to harden
 * two inline scripts we author ourselves (Next's hydration bootstrap and the
 * JSON-LD in lib/schema.tsx, which already escapes `<`) is the wrong way round.
 *
 * The directives that do the work here are the other ones: `frame-src` pins
 * embedding to Twitch, `connect-src` allows this origin and Google Analytics and
 * nothing else, and `form-action 'self'` stops the newsletter form being
 * repointed.
 *
 * The nonce question was left open "the day an analytics provider is wired", and
 * that day has come — but the answer has not changed. gtag.js is loaded from a
 * host, not inlined, so it needs no nonce; only our own two bootstrap lines are
 * inline, and they are the same self-authored scripts the trade was already
 * about. Revisit if a tag manager ever starts injecting third-party inline code,
 * which is the case 'unsafe-inline' would actually be dangerous for.

 * (region1.google-analytics.com and friends) take them for EU visitors. Miss any
