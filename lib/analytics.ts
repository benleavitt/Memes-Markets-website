/**
 * Event tracking, provider-agnostic.
 *
 * The provider is now Google Analytics 4, and the indirection this file was
 * built for paid off exactly as intended: wiring it was a change to the one
 * function below, not a hunt through every component that calls it.
 *
 * CONSENT IS NOT CHECKED HERE, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight.
 * Google's Consent Mode owns that decision — components/Analytics.tsx defaults
 * analytics_storage to denied, and the banner flips it. Adding a second gate
 * here would mean two sources of truth for the same question, and the one in
 * this file would be the one that quietly went stale.
 *
 * Every send is still conditional on gtag EXISTING, which it does not without
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID. A site with no measurement id sends nothing from here.

/**
 * A page view for a navigation the browser never made.
 *
 * `gtag('config', ...)` in components/Analytics.tsx sends exactly ONE page_view,
 * when the tag first loads. That is the right behaviour for a site where every
 * navigation is a document request, and the wrong behaviour for this one: the
 * footer links to /about, /partner, /privacy and /terms are next/link, so the
 * App Router swaps the page slot without a page load and Google never hears
 * about it. Left alone, GA4 would report a session as one landing page and
 * nothing else, and the four subpages would look like almost nobody visits them
 * — indistinguishable, in the reports, from a site nobody explores.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of AnalyticsEvent. That union is user intent — things a
 * person chose to do — and page_view is a lifecycle fact. Keeping them apart
 * stops "did anyone click Partner" and "did anyone land on /partner" turning
 * into the same question.
 *
 * The dev-mode branch mirrors track() so both behave the same way locally.
