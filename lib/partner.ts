/**
 * The partnership / sponsorship enquiry form.
 *
 *   <PartnerForm> ──> /api/partner ──> Apps Script web app ──> Google Sheet
 *
 * WHY IT GOES THROUGH OUR OWN ROUTE. The Apps Script URL is a public write
 * endpoint: anyone holding it can append rows to the sheet forever. Posting to
 * it from the browser would put it in the page source of every visitor. Keeping
 * it server-side means the only thing on the public internet is /api/partner,
 * which is rate-limited and origin-checked, and rotating the script URL is an
 * env var change rather than a redeploy of the client bundle.
 *
 * It is also why the form is not a Google Form in an iframe: that would work
 * with no code at all, but it cannot be styled, it drops a third-party frame on
 * the site, and it sends the one audience the site most wants to impress —
 * sponsors — to a page that looks nothing like the show.
